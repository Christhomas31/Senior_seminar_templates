\newblock Software testing research: Achievements, challenges, dreams.
\newblock In {\em 2007 Future of Software Engineering}, FOSE '07, pages
  85--103, Washington, DC, USA, 2007. IEEE Computer Society.
\newblock \emph{Validity: Very Good. This seems like a good article to read on
  testing in general. If this paper explores testing like I think it will, it
  may help set the tone of the entire paper and clarify important traits in
  testing. I think this will be a key background paper}.

\newblock Test driven development: the state of the practice.
\newblock In {\em Proceedings of the 50th Annual Southeast Regional
  Conference}, ACM-SE '12, pages 158--163, New York, NY, USA, 2012. ACM.
\newblock \emph{Validity: Good. This short article seems useful on getting the
  current scoop on Agile testing. I do not think that it will be a main paper
  unless it is very dense or relevant but I think it would serve well as a
  support or background paper.}

\newblock Agile testing: Past, present, and future -- charting a systematic map
  of testing in agile software development.
\newblock In {\em Agile Conference 2012}, AGILE 13, pages 55 -- 63, 2012.
\newblock \emph{Validity: Good. This article I think will be a useful summary
  article on agile testing. This article would make a useful background
  article. University may not be able to access this article, in that case this
  article will be ignored. }.

  symposium on Software testing and analysis}, ISSTA '10, pages 231--240, New
  York, NY, USA, 2010. ACM.
\newblock \emph{Validity: Very Good. This article seems very promising as its a
  recent paper that has research of the advantages of agile testing compared to
  conventional testing. The writers seem very credible in the field. This paper
  is likely to be a core paper unless its actually poorly written or doesnâ€™t
  mesh well with other papers.}

  Engineering}, ICSE 2012, pages 529--539, Piscataway, NJGood/Questionable,
  USA, 2012. IEEE Press.
\newblock \emph{Validity: Very Good. This article seems useful as it is a
  modern research paper on the effectiveness of agile testing practices. That
  being said one of the main downsides of this article is that it splits its
  attention between TDD and Pair programming which is concerning.}

\bibitem{Soeken:2012}

\newblock Assisted behavior driven development using natural language
  processing.
\newblock In {\em Proceedings of the 50th international conference on Objects,
  Models, Components, Patterns}, TOOLS'12, pages 269--287, Berlin, Heidelberg,
  2012. Springer-Verlag.
\newblock \emph{Validity: Good/Questionable. If I use this article it will be
  important to analyze it for credibility. This article focuses on english
  language like BDD testing and the advantages of that. Can be linked to agile
  testing principles through customer developer interactions. Worried how well
  this paper will merge with others if it becomes a core paper.}
